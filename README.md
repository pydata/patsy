# Patsy

**Notice:** `patsy` is no longer under active development. As of August 2021,
Matthew Wardrop (@matthewwardrop) and Tom√°s Capretto (@tomicapretto) have taken
on responsibility from Nathaniel Smith (@njsmith) for keeping the lights on, but
no new feature development is planned. The spiritual successor of this project
is [Formulaic](https://github.com/matthewwardrop/formulaic), and we
recommend that users [migrate](https://matthewwardrop.github.io/formulaic/migration/)
when possible. For the time being, until major software packages have successfully
transitioned, we will attempt to keep `patsy` working in its current state with
current releases in the Python ecosystem.

Patsy is a Python library for describing statistical models
(especially linear models, or models that have a linear component) and
building design matrices. Patsy brings the convenience of [R](http://www.r-project.org/) "formulas" to Python.
